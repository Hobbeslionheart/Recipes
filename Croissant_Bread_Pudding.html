Don’t be alarmed at the amount of butter in the recipe; brioche is supposed to be rich and indulgent, a great addition at brunches and holiday dinners or just as sandwich bread. The name “brioche” comes from the French word broyer, meaning to crush or grind, due to the excessive kneading that the traditional dough required, which can be as much as 45 minutes in some recipes. Of course, with our version, we keep it to a few seconds, or you can skip the kneading altogether and have a warm loaf of brioche ready in no time flat. </p> <p><strong itemprop="yield">Makes enough dough for at least three 1½‑pound loaves. The recipe is easily doubled or halved.</strong></p> </header> <!-- Ingredients: each ingredient as a recipeIngredient entry --> <section> <h2>Ingredients</h2> <ul> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups lukewarm water (100°F or below) — 12 ounces / 340 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon granulated yeast¹ — 0.35 ounce / 10 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1 tablespoon kosher salt¹ — 0.6 ounce / 17 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">6 large eggs, lightly beaten — 12 ounces / 340 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">½ cup honey — 6 ounces / 170 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">1½ cups unsalted butter, melted (3 sticks), plus butter for greasing the pan — 12 ounces / 340 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">7 cups all-purpose flour — 2 pounds, 3 ounces / 990 grams</li> <li itemprop="recipeIngredient">Egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water), for brushing the loaf</li> </ul> <p><small>¹Can decrease (see pages 15 and 33).</small></p> </section> <!-- Instructions: each step as HowToStep --> <section itemprop="recipeInstructions"> <h2>Instructions</h2> <ol> <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep"> <p itemprop="text"><strong>Mixing and storing the dough:</strong> Mix the water, yeast, salt, eggs, honey, and melted butter in a 6‑quart bowl or a lidded (not airtight) food container.</p> </li>
  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Add the flour:</strong> Mix in the flour without kneading; use a Danish dough whisk, a spoon, or a heavy‑duty stand mixer with the paddle. If you are not using a machine, you may need to use wet hands to incorporate the last bit of flour. The dough will be loose but will firm up when chilled; don’t try to work with it before chilling.</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Rest then refrigerate:</strong> Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature for 2 hours, and then refrigerate.</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Chill time and storage:</strong> The dough can be used as soon as it is thoroughly chilled, at least 3 hours. Refrigerate the container and use the dough over the next 5 days. (To freeze dough, see page 42.)</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Prepare for shaping and baking day:</strong> On baking day, grease an 8½ × 4½‑inch nonstick loaf pan generously with butter. Dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour and cut off a 1½‑pound portion (a small loaf portion). Place that portion on a lightly floured surface and quickly shape it into a smooth ball.</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Shape and proof in pan:</strong> Place the smooth ball seam side down into the prepared loaf pan. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for about 90 minutes (the dough will rise and fill the pan).</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Preheat oven:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) with a rack placed in the center of the oven.</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Egg wash:</strong> Brush the top of the loaf with egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water).</p>
  </li>

  <li itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/HowToStep">
    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for about 45 minutes, or until medium golden brown and well set. (If an instant‑read thermometer is used, internal temperature should be in the typical range for breads — see your thermometer guidelines.)</p>

    <p itemprop="text"><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow to cool on a rack before serving.</p>

</section> <!-- Variation: Brioche à Tête --> <section> <h2>Variation: Brioche à Tête</h2> <p> Follow the Brioche recipe but use 1 pound (grapefruit‑size portion) of dough for each small brioche. Pinch off a piece the size of a ping‑pong ball; place the larger piece into a greased brioche pan or small muffin pan and place the ping‑pong sized ball on top to form the tête (head). Poke a fairly deep indentation in the top of the ball of dough. This is where you will attach the tete (“head”). Form the smaller ball into a teardrop shape by rolling one end to a point, then place the teardrop pointed side down into the indentation on the larger piece of dough. Rest for 75 minutes, brush with egg wash, and bake for about 35 minutes. </p> </section> <footer> <p><small>Source text transcribed from photographed book pages (Bread in 5 Minutes a Day — "Brioche" section).</small></p> </footer> </article> </body> </html>
