  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p itemprop="description">I love gnocchi. Little Italian potato dumplings have only started to appear in grocery stores in the last few years, but they’ve appeared in a very big way. Now all of my local stores carry multiple brands and I couldn’t be happier. This beef stew uses gnocchi in place of noodles or traditional drop dumplings for something totally unique without adding any extra prep work.</p>
